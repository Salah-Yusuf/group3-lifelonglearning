					<h1>Hello, I’m Hazyq Norashraf</h1>
					<p>
						I’m an 18-year-old student currently pursuing a Foundation in Computing at MMU. You might be wondering—why MMU? Why choose FCI?
My answer is simple: Why not?

I’ve been passionate about IT since high school, where I first discovered my interest through Computer Science in Form 4. That early spark grew into a genuine curiosity about coding, problem-solving, and how technology shapes the world around us.

As for MMU, I chose it because of its strong reputation in the industry. Many professionals I’ve met often mention that MMU students are highly regarded and prioritized when it comes to opportunities in the tech field. That gave me the confidence to believe this is the right place to start my journey.

      <p>Working as a barista was hectic at times, but fun too. 
		I got used to the rush, picked up some latte art (kinda), and even memorized regulars’ orders. 
		It taught me patience, confidence, and how to stay chill under pressure.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					As I reflect on myself, I realize that I am still on a journey of growth, constantly learning from both successes and challenges. 
                    I take pride in my creativity and determination, which allow me to express my ideas and push forward even when situations feel difficult. 
                    At the same time, I acknowledge that I sometimes struggle with self-doubt and hesitation, but I try to view these moments as opportunities to learn rather than failures. 
                    I am beginning to understand that growth often comes from discomfort, and that mistakes can be valuable lessons. 
                    Moving forward, I hope to strengthen my confidence, remain open to learning from others, and use my skills not only for personal success but also to inspire and support those around me.
				</p>
                <div class="video-container">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uzDsT-25w14?si=MDGsjb3VF-g29Ywj" title="Reflection Video"  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
                </iframe>
				<p>The video highlights how personal empowerment comes from reflection and continuous learning, and this really reflects me because I take responsibility for my own growth, regularly looking back at my experiences to see what worked and what didn’t, and using that reflection to improve. Like the video suggests, I’m not afraid to experiment, try different approaches, and learn from trial and error, because I see growth as a lifelong process rather than something with an endpoint. This mindset helps me stay open to change, keep refining my skills, and feel confident that each step forward—no matter how small—is part of my progress.</p>
